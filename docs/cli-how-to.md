<!-- I think cli must be after "AEA quick start" and before "Developer Guide" or between "Step by Step" and "Skills"-->

The command line interface is the easiest way to build an AEA.

## Installation

The following installs the AEA cli package.

``` bash
pip install aea[cli]
```

The following installs the entire AEA package including the cli.

``` bash
pip install aea[all]

```
