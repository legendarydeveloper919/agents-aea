## Preparation instructions

### Dependencies

Follow the <a href="../quickstart/#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a> and <a href="../quickstart/#installation">Installation</a> sections from the AEA quick start.


## Demo instructions

First, create a new AEA project:

``` bash
aea create my_aea
cd my_aea
```

Second, run the generator on the sample specification.
``` bash
aea generate protocol ../examples/protocol_specification_ex/sample.yaml
```
This will generate the protocol and place it in your AEA project.

Third, try generating other protocols by first defining a specification, then running the generator.
