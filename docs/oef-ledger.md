In the AEA framework universe, agents run alongside OEF search and discovery nodes which are running against the Fetch.ai ledger and external ledger systems.

Currently, you need to run your own OEF node for local development and testing.

To start an OEF node follow the <a href="../quickstart/#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a> sections from the AEA quick start. Then run:

``` bash
python scripts/oef/launch.py -c ./scripts/oef/launch_config.json
```

We will soon make a public OEF network available.
