The AEA is a framework for autonomous economic agent (AEA) development. It gives developers a quick and efficient way to build autonomous economic agents. 

The framework is super modular, easily extensible, and highly composable. It is ideal for Reinforcement Learning scenarios.

## Agents

An autonomous economic agent (AEA) is an intelligent agent whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner. Their super powers lie in their ability to autonomously acquire new skills.

AEAs achieve their goals with the help of the OEF and the Fetch.AI Ledger. 

Third party systems, such as Ethereum, may also allow AEA integration.
