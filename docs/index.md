The AEA framework is a Python ecosystem for autonomous economic agent (AEA) development. 

It equips developers with a simple to understand and efficient set of tools for building autonomous economic agents. 

The framework is super modular, easily extensible, and highly composable. It is ideal for reinforcement learning scenarios. 

The AEA framework attempts to make agent development as straightforward as many popular web frameworks.


## Our vision

The AEA framework has two focused commercial roles.

### Open source technology

We are creating infrastructure for agent developers to use to build their own solutions. 

AEA users are, among others:

* Data scientists.
* Machine learning experts.
* Engineers.
* Economists.
* Web developers.
* Students/Academics.
* AI/ML/MAS Researchers.
* Crypto passionates.
* Indie developers.


### Platform for start ups

By operating as a platform for start ups, we envisage the AEA framework to be in a continuous growth pattern.

With start up grants we will kick start solutions while testing product-problem fit and identifying our user base.

<!-- Both successes and failures allow us to conceive new hypotheses and hence offer opportunities. -->


## Agents

An autonomous economic agent (AEA) is an intelligent agent whose goal is generating economic value for its owner. 

The AEA super power is the ability to autonomously acquire new skills.

AEAs achieve their goals with the help of the Fetch.AI OEF and the Fetch.AI Ledger.

Third party systems, such as Ethereum, may also allow AEA integration.
