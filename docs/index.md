The AEA framework is an ecosystem for autonomous economic agent (AEA) development. It equips developers with a quick and efficient set of tools for building autonomous economic agents. 

The framework is super modular, easily extensible, and highly composable. It is ideal for reinforcement learning scenarios. 

The AEA framework is similar to many popular web frameworks.


## Our vision

The AEA framework has two focused commercial roles.

### Open source company

We are creating infrastructure for external to use to build their own solutions. 

AEA users are:

* Data scientists.
* Machine learning experts.
* Engineers.
* Economists.
* Web developers.


### Platform for start ups

By operating as a platform for start ups, we envisage the AEA framework to be in a continuous growth pattern.

With start up grants, similar to those Ethereum offers, we will kickstart solutions whilst testing product-problem fit and identifying our user base.

Both successes and failures allow us to develop new hypotheses and so offer enhanced business opportunity.



## Agents

An autonomous economic agent (AEA) is an intelligent agent whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner. Its super power lies in its ability to autonomously acquire new skills.

AEAs achieve their goals with the help of the OEF and the Fetch.AI Ledger. 

Third party systems, such as Ethereum, may also allow AEA integration.
