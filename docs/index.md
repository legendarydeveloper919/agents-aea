The AEA is a framework for autonomous economic agent (AEA) development. It gives developers a quick and efficient way to build autonomous economic agents. 

The framework is super modular, easily extensible, and highly composable. It is ideal for Reinforcement Learning scenarios. 


## Our vision

Fetch.AI intends the AEA framework to have two focused commercial roles.

### Open source company

We want to build infrastructure with which external parties build their own solutions.

### Platform for start ups

By operating as a platform for start ups, we hope to solve the chicken-or-egg problem through incentive schemes.



## Agents

An autonomous economic agent (AEA) is an intelligent agent whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner. Their super powers lie in their ability to autonomously acquire new skills.

AEAs achieve their goals with the help of the OEF and the Fetch.AI Ledger. 

Third party systems, such as Ethereum, may also allow AEA integration.
