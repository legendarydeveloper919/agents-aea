The AEA framework provides the infrastructure for creating autonomous economic agents (AEA). 

It is a Python-based development suite which equips developers with an efficient and easy to understand set of tools for building autonomous economic agents. 

The framework is super modular, easily extensible, and highly composable. 

The AEA framework attempts to make agent development as straightforward as web development using popular web frameworks.


## Our vision

The AEA framework has two focused commercial roles.

### Open source technology

We are creating infrastructure for developers to build their own agent-based solutions. 

AEA users are, among others:

* Data scientists
* Economists
* Researchers (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems)
* Engineers
* Machine learning experts
* Independent developers
* Students/Academics
* Crypto passionates
* Web developers

### Platform for start ups

By operating as a platform for start ups, we envisage the AEA framework to be in a continuous growth pattern.

With start up grants we will kick start solutions while testing product-problem fit and identifying our user base.

<!-- Both successes and failures allow us to conceive new hypotheses and hence offer opportunities. -->


## Agents

An autonomous economic agent (AEA) is an intelligent agent whose goal is generating economic value for its owner. 

The AEA super power is the ability to autonomously acquire new skills.

AEAs achieve their goals with the help of the Fetch.AI OEF and the Fetch.AI Ledger.

Third party systems, such as Ethereum, may also allow AEA integration.
