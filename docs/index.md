The AEA is a framework for autonomous economic agent (AEA) development. It gives developers a quick and efficient way to build autonomous economic agents. 

The framework is super modular, easily extensible, and highly composable. It is ideal for reinforcement learning scenarios. 

You may recognise our approach as similar to popular web frameworks.


## Our vision

Fetch.AI intends the AEA framework to have two focused commercial roles.

### Open source company

We are creating infrastructure which external parties can use to build their own solutions. 

Our AEA users are:

* Data scientists.
* Machine learning experts.
* Engineers.
* Economists.
* Web developers.


### Platform for start ups

By operating as a platform for start ups, we envisage the AEA framework ecosystem will be in a continuous growth pattern.

With start up grants, similar to those Ethereum offers, we will kickstart solutions whilst testing product-problem fit.

Both success and failure allows us to develop new hypotheses and so offer enhanced creative opportunity.

Our iterative experiences will allow us to identify our user base and test those problem hypotheses.



## Agents

An autonomous economic agent (AEA) is an intelligent agent whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner. Its super power lies in its ability to autonomously acquire new skills.

AEAs achieve their goals with the help of the OEF and the Fetch.AI Ledger. 

Third party systems, such as Ethereum, may also allow AEA integration.
