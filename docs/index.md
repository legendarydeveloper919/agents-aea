The AEA framework provides the tools for creating Autonomous Economic Agents (AEA).

## What are AEAs?

We define an autonomous economic agent or AEA as:

> an intelligent agent acting on an owner's behalf, with limited or no interference, and whose goal is to generate economic value to its owner.

<!-- In short, "software that generates economic value for you". -->

AEAs act independently of constant input from their owner and autonomously execute actions to achieve their prescribed goals. Their purpose is to create economic value for you, their owner, in clearly defined domains. AEAs have a wide range of <a href="app-areas">application areas</a> and we provide <a href="demos">demo guides</a> to highlight examples of their use cases.

<!-- Autonomous Economic Agents are digital entities that run complex dynamic decision-making algorithms for application owners and clients. -->

AEAs are not:

* just any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent"  target="_blank">agents</a>: AEAs' purpose is to generate economic value in a multi-stakeholder environment with competing incentives between agents. They represent humans, organisations or objects.
* APIs or sensors which do not have agency.
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank">smart contracts</a> which do not display any proactiveness and are purely reactive to external requests (=contract calls and transactions). 
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" target="_blank">artificial general intelligence (AGI)</a>: AEAs can have a very narrow, goal directed focus involving some economic gain and can be implemented via simple conditional logic.


## What is the AEA Framework?

The AEA framework is a Python-based development suite which equips you with an efficient and accessible set of tools for building AEAs. The framework is modular, extensible, and composable. It attempts to make agent development as straightforward an experience as possible, similar to web development using popular web frameworks.

AEAs achieve their goals with the help of a decentralized search & discovery system for agents the <a href="oef-ledger">simple Open Economic Framework (sOEF)</a>, the <a href="acn">Agent Communication Network</a> - a decentralized communication system for agents - and using <a href="oef-ledger">Fetch.ai's blockchain</a> as a financial settlement and commitment layer. AEAs can also be integrated with third-party blockchains, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>.


## Why build with the AEA Framework?

The AEA framework provides the developer with a number of features which cannot be found in this combination anywhere else:

* the peer-to-peer <a href="acn">agent communication network</a> allows your AEAs to interact with all other AEAs over the public internet
* the search and discovery system <a href="simple-oef">sOEF</a> allows your AEAs to find other agents
* the <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/" target="_blank">AEA registry</a> enables code sharing and re-use
* the framework's <a href="ledger-integration">crypto and ledger APIs</a> make it possible for AEAs to interact with blockchains
* reusability of code for interacting with blockchains is enabled via the <a href="contract">contract</a> packages
