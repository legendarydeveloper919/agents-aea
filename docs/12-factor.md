# Relationship with the Twelve-Factor App methodology.

The [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) is
a set of best practices to build modern
web applications, or *software-as-a-service*.

In this section, we will see how the AEA framework
facilitates the achievement of those
in the development, release and deployment 
phases of an AEA project. 

Note that an AEA instance, as a software agent,
can be seen as a more general case of a web app,
as it not only shows reactive behaviour,
but it is also *proactive*, depending
on the goals assigned to it.

> Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

TODO

## Port binding

> Export services via port binding

TODO

## Concurrency

> Scale out via the process model

TODO
