We have collated 8 principles which guide AEA framework development:

* Accessibility: easy to use.
* Modularity: encourages module creation and sharing.
* Openness: easily extensible with third party libraries.
* Conciseness: conceptually simple.
* Value-driven: drives immediate value for some use case.
* Low entry barriers: leverages existing programming languages and web protocols.
* Safety: safe for the user (economically speaking).
* Goal alignment: seamless facilitation of user preferences and goals.
