We have collated 8 principles which guide AEA framework development:

* **Accessibility**: easy of use.
* **Modularity**: encourages module creation and sharing and reuse.
* **Openness**: easily extensible with third party libraries.
* **Conciseness**: conceptually simple.
* **Value-driven**: drives immediate value.
<!--* **Low entry barriers**: leverages existing programming languages and web protocols.-->
* **Safety**: safe for the user (economically speaking). <!--I suggest changing this to transparency. It is often difficult to show that a system is "safe". There are degrees of safety. What is achievable is in-depth analysis of whatever (e.g. system, method, etc) we propose and transparency about its characteristics (e.g. risk-level associated with a specific method for economic interaction)-->     
* **Goal alignment**: seamless facilitation of users' preferences and goals.
