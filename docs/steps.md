There are a number of ways to build an AEA:
<ul>
	<li>We recommended you build an AEA project step-by-step with the CLI tool as demonstrated in the <a href="../quickstart/" target=_blank>quick start</a> guide. See information on the CLI tool <a href="../cli-how-to/" target=_blank>here</a> and read on below.</li>
	<li>Using the CLI <code>aea fetch</code> command, pull in an already built project and run as is or extend it to your needs.</li>
	<li>The last option is to install the AEA without the CLI tool with <code>pip install aea</code> and, from there, import classes directly. See the guide for programmatically building an AEA like this <a href="../build-aea-programmatically/" target=_blank>here</a>.</li>
</ul>

Building an AEA step by step:
<ol>
<li>Set up your AEA project.</li>
<li>Add the right <a href="../connection/">connections</a> for your usecase.</li>
<li>Add or code the <a href="../protocol/">protocols</a> you require.</li>
<li>Add or code the <a href="../skill/">skills</a> you need. <a href="../skill-guide/">This guide</a> shows you step by step how to develop a skill.</li>
<li>Where required, scaffold any of the above resources with the <a href="../scaffolding/">scaffolding tool</a> or generate a protocol with the <a href="../generator/">protocol generator</a>.</li>
<li>Now, run your AEA.</li> 
</ol>
