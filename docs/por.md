An AEA can use several key pairs. In particular, it can use different keys for securing its communication and for engaging in exchange. In the ACN we make use of this fact. To be able to signal to other agents that one key pair is allowed to represent another, the key pair which is being represented must sign a message to prove that the other key pair is allowed to represent it.
