	Work in progress.


The framework can be divided into two parts. The core framework which constitutes the AEA framework developed by the Fetch.AI team and external contributers ad well as extensions (packages) which can be developed by any developer. This allows for a modular and scalable agent framework. There exist currently three types of packages which can be added to the framework as modules:

* Skills
* Protocols
* Connections

We first provide a graphical illustration of the framework and then discuss its components:
