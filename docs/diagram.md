!!!	Note
	Work in progress.


The framework can be divided into two parts: a) a **core** part that is developed by the Fetch.AI team as well as external contributors, 
and b) **extensions** (also known as **packages**) developed by any developer. This allows for a modular and scalable framework. 
Currently, the framework supports three types of packages which can be added to the core part as modules:

* Skills
* Protocols
* Connections

The following figure illustrates the framework's architecture: 

<!-- This figure is too small and low quality. Suggest making a vector version (svg file). Typo in the figure: "Act: calls Behaviours active on fil*t*er"
In general the figure is difficult to understand. Change "X active" to "active X". Also would be nice to see the agent box in the figure. -->
