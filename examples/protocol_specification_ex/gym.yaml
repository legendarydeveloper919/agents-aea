    action: Action
    step_id: pt:int

    step_id: pt:int
    observation: Observation
    reward: pt:float

  # Problems:
  # info is of type dict[str, Any]. Any is problematic.
  #
  # Differences:
  # Previously action and observation were of type 'Any'. 'Any' is problematic. We decided to use custom types instead.
