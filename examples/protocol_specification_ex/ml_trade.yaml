    data: Tuple[Array, Array]

  # Differences:
  # data -> data was of type Tuple[np.ndarrays, np.ndarrays]. Now Array as a custom type is used instead of np.ndarrays.
  # Constraint on data -> data: Tuple were defined (the shape of the two elements must match). These constraints are not captured here yet.
