# RL agent & gym

## Dependencies

This example requires `numpy` and `gym` in addition to the dependencies of the `aea` package.

## Run

Cd into the directory and execute:

`
python rl_agent_v1.py
`

The RLAgent abstracts the environment but directly implements the reinforcement learning logic.

or 

`
python rl_agent_v2.py
`

which has the usual RL setup.
